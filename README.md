## Project Title

### Overview

This project presents a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model architecture designed for image classification tasks. The architecture is constructed using the Keras Sequential API, enabling easy layer-by-layer model creation.

### Key Components

- **Sequential Model Building:** Sequential model creation allows for the layer-by-layer construction of the CNN architecture.

- **Dropout Layer:** Integration of dropout layers with a 50% dropout rate helps prevent overfitting by randomly dropping input units during training.

- **Flatten Layer:** Utilization of the Flatten layer converts multi-dimensional input tensors into a single dimension, facilitating compatibility with Dense layers.

- **Dense Layer with Softmax Activation:** Incorporation of Dense layers with softmax activation function aids in outputting probabilities across multiple classes.

### Model Compilation

The model is compiled using the following configurations:

- **Adam Optimization:** An adaptive stochastic gradient descent method that adjusts the learning rate based on first and second-order moments estimation.
  
- **Categorical Crossentropy Loss:** A suitable loss function for multi-class classification models, particularly when there are two or more output labels.

### Callbacks

- **ModelCheckpoint:** Employed during model training with model.fit() to save either the entire model or just the weights at specified intervals. This enables the resumption of training from the saved state.

- **EarlyStopping:** Used to halt training when a monitored metric, such as validation loss or accuracy, has stopped improving. This helps prevent overfitting and unnecessary training iterations.
